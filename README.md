# ðŸŽ¯ C++ Learning Roadmap & Project Tracker  

This repo tracks my progress as I learn C++ through hands-on projects.  
Each project introduces new concepts and builds on the previous ones.

## âœ… Completed Projects  

### [x] 1. Math Stats Tool  
- [x] Input a range of numbers  
- [x] Calculate sum, average, median  
- [x] Calculate variance & standard deviation  
- [x] Prime check and even/odd detection  
- [x] Show min & max values  
- **Concepts learned**: loops, conditionals, functions, vectors, type casting, modular programming  

**Stretch Goals**:  
- [ ] Read numbers from a file instead of input  
- [ ] Write results to a file (report style)  
- [ ] Add menu system for choosing which stats to calculate  
- [ ] Handle very large numbers safely (`long long`)

### [x] 2. Guess the Number Game  
- [x] Difficulty levels (Beginner â†’ Very Hard)  
- [x] Adjustable number of attempts  
- [x] Random number generation within ranges  
- [x] Feedback (too high, too low, out of range)  
- [x] Scoring system (difficulty Ã— guesses)  
- [x] Leaderboard with replay options  
- **Concepts learned**: arrays, random numbers, input handling, game loops, vectors, scoring  

**Stretch Goals**:  
- [ ] Add timer (bonus points for guessing quickly)  
- [ ] Save leaderboard to file so it persists between sessions  
- [ ] Add multiplayer mode (take turns guessing)  
- [ ] Add difficulty scaling: number range grows each round

## ðŸ“Œ Upcoming Projects  

### [ ] 3. Student Gradebook Manager  
- [x] Add students (name, ID, grades)  
- [x] Calculate average, highest, lowest grade  
- [x] Save/load student data to file  
- [ ] Display students sorted by grade or name  
- **Skills**: structs/classes, file I/O, sorting (`std::sort`), menus  

**Stretch Goals**:  
- [x] Store multiple classes (Math, English, etc.)  
- [ ] Weighted average (different subjects worth different percentages)  
- [ ] Save data in CSV format  
- [ ] Search students by ID or name

### [ ] 4. Bank Account Simulator  
- [ ] Create accounts with balance  
- [ ] Deposit, withdraw, transfer between accounts  
- [ ] Save/load account info to file  
- [ ] Add PIN authentication  
- **Skills**: classes, encapsulation, validation, file I/O  

**Stretch Goals**:  
- [ ] Add interest calculation  
- [ ] Add transaction history (log deposits/withdrawals)  
- [ ] Add admin mode (view all accounts)  
- [ ] Simulate ATM interface (menu system)  

---

### [ ] 5. Simple Text Adventure Game  
- [ ] Player moves between rooms  
- [ ] Collect items & encounter enemies  
- [ ] Menu-driven choices (e.g., Go North, Attack, Pick up item)  
- [ ] Extend with random events or combat  
- **Skills**: enums, classes, state handling, randomization, game logic  

**Stretch Goals**:  
- [ ] Add save/load feature  
- [ ] Procedurally generate random maps  
- [ ] Add simple combat system with health & damage  
- [ ] Add ASCII art for fun  

---

### [ ] 6. Mini File-Based To-Do List  
- [ ] Add tasks  
- [ ] Mark tasks as done  
- [ ] Delete tasks  
- [ ] Save tasks to file and load on program start  
- [ ] Sort tasks by priority or date  
- **Skills**: file I/O, vectors of structs/classes, sorting, menus  

**Stretch Goals**:  
- [ ] Add deadlines & auto-sort by date  
- [ ] Export to a CSV or text file  
- [ ] Color-code tasks (done vs pending) in console  
- [ ] Add recurring tasks
